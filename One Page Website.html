<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;text-align:center">Pair of great horned owlets hanging out in popular Victoria park</h1>
<p> A pair of great horned owl chicks are delighting the community around Victoria's Beacon Hill Park, but one expert is reminding residents that while it's exciting to see young owls, they are wild animals that require space.

Jannaca Chick, vice president of the Rocky Point Bird Observatory and head owl bander for the owl banding program says it's "unusual" for great horned owls to be nesting so visibly in a busy, public park â€” especially because the trees haven't got many leaves at this time of year for them to hide behind.

"It's a real treat to have these owls on display," she told On The Island guest host Kathryn Marlow. 

The owlets are still small, with fuzzy white feathers. When they get older, their colouring will help them camouflage when they're perched next to a tree truck, Chick said. 

"They have these large, intimidating yellow eyes. They're quite a large bird."</p>
